        "Bio": "Judith of Flanders (or Judith of France) was the oldest child of Charles the Bald, King of the West Franks and Holy Roman Emperor, and his first wife Ermentrude of Orléans. She was born about 843, most likely in Orléans. On 1 October 856, at Verberie in northern France, Judith married Æthelwulf, King of Wessex. Æthelwulf was about sixty-one years old and Judith was age 12 to 14. The marriage was a diplomatic alliance and as part of the arrangement Charles insisted his daughter be crowned Queen. Judith was crowned queen and anointed by Hincmar, Archbishop of Rheims. Although empresses had been anointed before, this is the first definitely known anointing of a Carolingian queen. The marriage itself was unusual in that Carolingian princesses rarely married, were usually sent to nunneries, and it was almost unknown for them to marry foreigners. The marriage provoked a rebellion by Æthelwulf's eldest surviving son, Æthelbald, probably because he feared displacement by a higher-born half-brother. Æthelwulf, died on 13 January 858, married a little over a year, Judith was still no more than 14 or 15, the marriage produced no children. Æthelbald, succeed his father as King of Wessex and immediately married Judith, his step-mother, probably to enhance his status because she was the daughter of the West Frankish king. Æthelbald died in July 860, they had been married two-and-a-half years. Judith was no more than 17 years old, she had been twice married, twice widowed, twice been the Queen of Wessex ad she was still childless. Done with Wessex, Judith sold her properties and went home to France. Her father Charles the Bald promptly put her in the Monastery at Senlis, \"under his protection, with all the honour due to a queen, until such time as she might marry suitably and legally.\" Around Christmas 861, Judith escaped and eloped with Baldwin (Count of Flanders) to the Flemish city of Harelbeke. Judith's brother Louis had given his consent but her father Charles the Bald was furious and tried to have the couple excommunicated. Thy fled to Rome and appealed to the Pope. Pope Nicholas I convinced Judith's father to accept the union and welcome the young couple into his circle. They were officially married at Auxerre on 13 December 862.  Baldwin was given the County of Flanders to protect from Viking attacks. He not only succeeded in quelling the threat, but expanded both his army and his territory quickly, and became a faithful supporter of King Charles. Baldwin became known as \"Iron Arm\" and the March of Baldwin came to be known as the County of Flanders and would become one of the most powerful principalities of France.  Judith finally had children. She and Baldwin are known to have had: Charles (c. 864/865 – died young), named after Judith's father, Charles the Bald  Baldwin II (c. 865/867 – c. 10 September 918). Succeeded his father as Margrave (Count) of Flanders. Married Ælfthryth, daughter of Alfred the Great  Raoul or Ralph (Rodulf) (c. 867/870 – murdered 17 June 896). Became Count of Cambrai around 888; he and his brother joined King Zwentibold of Lotharingia in 895, attacked Vermandois and captured Arras, Saint-Quentin and Peronne, and ended up captured and killed by Herbert I of Vermandois  Guinidilda, who married Wilfred I the Hairy, Count of Barcelona  Judith's exact date of death is not known, however, it is believed about 870, certainly before Baldwin who died in 879, they are both believed to be buried in the Abbey of St-Bertin, near Saint-Omer."

Charles was born June 13, 823 in Frankfurt am Main, and was named Charles after his famous and powerful grandfather. His older brothers are Lothair I, Pepin of Aquitaine, and Louis the German. Charles married Ermentrude of Orléans, daughter of Odo I, Count of Orléansin, in 842 and they had 10 children: Judith of Flanders, Louis the Stammerer, Charles the Child, Lothar, Germain, Carloman, Rotrud and Ermentrud (both who became nuns), Hildegard, Gisela, and Godehilde. Ermentrude died October 6 869 and in 870 Charles married Richilde of the Ardennes, daughter of Bivin of Gorze, Count of the Ardennes. Together they had5 more children: Rothilde, Drogo, Pippin, a son who died an infant in 875, and Charles.  Charles the Bald was not bald, he is pictured with a full head of hair. 'The Bald' rather refers to his lack of lands when he was young. Charles would spend most of his life in a power struggle with his older brothers over the lands conquered by their grandfather. Charles older brother Pepin died in 838 and Charles was made King of Aquitaine. His father Louis the Pious died in 840 and war erupted between his sons. Oldest son Lothair consolidated control of Middle Francia and became Emperor of Rome. Charles allied with his brother Louis against their older brother. Louis became King of East Francia (King of Germany) and Charles King of West Francia (King of France) After the death of his brother Lothair and then his brothers son Emperor Louis II, Charles traveled to Rome and was crowned Holy Roman Emperor by Pope John VIII on December 25, 875.  Charles died on 6 October 877 in Brides-les-Bains while crossing the pass of Mont Cenis. He was buried initially at the abbey of Nantua, Burgundy but a few years later, his remains were transferred to the Abbey of Saint-Denis where he had long wished to be buried."

But the dividing line between wives and concubines was not clear-cut in eighth-century Francia, and it is likely that the accusation of \"illegitimacy\" derives from the desire of Pepin's first wife Plectrude to see her progeny as heirs to Pepin's power."

Upon his father's death, Theudebert had to fight both his uncles Childebert and Clotaire I to inherit his father's kingdom. In the end, his military prowess persuaded Childebert to abandon the dispute and adopt Theudebert as his heir. Together they campaigned against Clotaire but sued for peace after their armies were hit by storm."
